Make money and speed up your website at the same time. Arc is the world's first Content Delivery Network (CDN) that pays you to use it.


== Description ==

Arc ([https://arc.io/](https://arc.io/)) offers websites a new currency to make money: unused device bandwidth from users.

How? While users browse your site, Arc uses the latest HTML5 APIs to turn their browsers into little servers in a peer-to-peer [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDN). Your users, and users on other sites with Arc, cooperatively load content from each other instead of from slower servers. We rent this fast, people-powered CDN to you and other websites, and you get paid for the bandwidth your users share while they browse your site.

This plugin adds Arc to your website. Once installed, your users get a faster experience with Arc's CDN and you start making money.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much money can I make with Arc? =

Estimate how much money your website could make here: [https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings](https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings).

Most websites can both pay less for Arc's new, peer-to-peer CDN and simultaneously make money. Some websites, like content-heavy sites, buy more CDN than they earn in Arc revenue. Other sites, like those with many users, earn more in Arc revenue than they buy in CDN.

= How does the widget work? =

Arc creates a communal, distributed CDN with the latest HTML5 APIs — [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) to connect browsers, [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to fulfill requests, [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to cache data, and [WebCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to do it all securely. And it never impacts the user experience. Ever. Arc uses only a small portion of spare bandwidth, imperceptible CPU, 100MB of browser cache, and only runs when a device is both powered and connected to Wi-Fi.

= Where does the money I get paid come from? =

Arc is a two-sided market. On one side of the market, websites buy a fast, low-cost peer-to-peer CDN. On the other side, websites make money by contributing bandwidth to the the peer-to-peer CDN. Arc's widget provides access to both sides.

= How do I get paid? =

You get paid via PayPal -- daily, weekly, bimonthly, or monthly.

You can configure your PayPal payments on the payouts page, here: [https://portal.arc.io/earnings](https://portal.arc.io/earnings).
