Monetize and speed up your website at the same time with Arc's unique plugin for WordPress.


== Description ==

Arc ([https://arc.io/](https://arc.io/)) offers digital publishers a new currency to sustain their businesses: unused device bandwidth from users. Your visitors will be crowdfunding your infrastructure in real time with spare bandwidth, not their wallets or personal data.

Download this plugin to enable Arc's widget on your pages: while users browse your sites, with no noticeable change in performance for them, the widget aggregates their unused internet connection to help power yours and other sites: a people-powered content delivery network (CDN). 

Your site performance improves, and the longer users stay on your site, the more that site offsets hosting costs and earns passive revenue diversified from ads, donations and subscriptions.


== Installation ==

After activating this plugin, complete the installation on this plugin's settings page (Plugins > Arc). Configuration is easy and just takes a few minutes.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the widget work? =

Arc uses the latest HTML5 APIs — WebRTC to connect browsers, ServiceWorker to fulfill requests, IndexedDB to cache data, and WebCrypto to do it all securely — to create a browser-based CDN in a single <script> tag. And the user experience is never impacted. Ever. Arc uses only a small portion of spare bandwidth, imperceptible CPU, 100MB of cache, and only runs when a device is both powered and connected to Wi-Fi.

= How much money can I make with Arc? =

Estimate how much money your website could make here: [https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings](https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings).
Most websites can both pay less for Arc's new, peer-to-peer CDN and simultaneously make money. Some websites, like content-heavy sites, buy more CDN than they earn in Arc revenue. Other sites, like those with lots of users, earn more in Arc revenue than they buy in CDN.

= Where does the money I get paid come from? =

Arc is a two-sided market. On one side of the market, websites buy a fast, low-cost peer-to-peer CDN. On the other side, websites make money by contributing bandwidth to the the peer-to-peer CDN. Arc's widget provides access to both sides.

= How do I get paid? =

You get paid via PayPal -- daily, weekly, bimonthly, or monthly.

You can configure your PayPal payments on the payouts page, here: [https://portal.arc.io/earnings](https://portal.arc.io/earnings).
