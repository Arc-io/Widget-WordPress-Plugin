Make money. Cut costs. Speed up your website.

Arc is the world's first Content Delivery Network (CDN) that pays you to use it.


== Description ==

This plugin adds Arc ([https://arc.io/](https://arc.io/)) to your website.

Estimate how much money your website could make here: [https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings](https://arc.io/#estimateEarnings).

While users browse your site, Arc unites some of their spare device bandwidth into a peer-to-peer CDN. Websites rent this Content Delivery Network (CDN), revenue is pooled, and Arc pays you for time users spend at your site.

You get a faster site and make money, without ads.

Arc uses the latest HTML5 APIs — WebRTC to connect browsers, ServiceWorker to fulfill requests, IndexedDB to cache data, and WebCrypto to do it all securely — to create a browser-based CDN in a single <script> tag. And the user experience is never impacted. Ever. Arc uses only a small portion of spare bandwidth, imperceptible CPU, 100MB of cache, and only runs when a device is both powered and connected to Wi-Fi.


== Installation ==

After activating this plugin, complete the installation on this plugin's settings page (Plugins > Arc).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does the money I get paid come from? =

Arc is a two-sided market. On one side of the market, websites buy a fast, low-cost peer-to-peer CDN. On the other side, websites make money by contributing bandwidth to the the peer-to-peer CDN. Arc's widget provides access to both sides.

Most websites can both pay less for Arc's new, peer-to-peer CDN and simultaneously make money. Some websites, like content-heavy sites, buy more CDN than they earn in Arc revenue. Other sites, like those with lots of users, earn more in Arc revenue than they buy in CDN.

= How do I get paid? =

You get paid via PayPal -- daily, weekly, bimonthly, or monthly.

You can configure your PayPal payments on the payouts page, here: [https://portal.arc.io/earnings](https://portal.arc.io/earnings).
